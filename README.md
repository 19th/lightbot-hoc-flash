Attempt to make simple page to run Lightbot Hour of Code version with Ruffle emulator

I'm not the owner of brand or code of Lightbot, nor somehow realted to brand or company. I just republished it to Github, so it would be available to my students and other students accross the world because I still see big value in it's genious and simplicity.
